Library Management System
Version 1.0 2023-11-17

##Description
 
This application allows users to check out books from the library using their own account. They will be able to write a review and rate books in the Library inventory. These reviews will allow the application to provide feedback to other users in the library and give the users recommendations based on that feedback.

Users and Librarians will have profiles that contain information necessary to track books checked out, and books that have been reserved. Each user will have a list of reserved books and books currently checked out as well as previously checkout titles. Books are reserved by the next available due date by title and author the book ID is added to the wait list by soonest available.

Librarians will be able to manage the book inventory and track late fees.
